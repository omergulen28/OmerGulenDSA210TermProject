# Chess Move Pattern Analysis

Project Proposal
This project analyzes my online chess games to uncover patterns in my playing style.
The main research questions include:
What is my most frequent opening move?
On average, at which move do I bring my queen into the game?
How many moves do my games typically last?
Do I play differently depending on whether I play white or black?
The goal is to gain personal insight into my gameplay and explore data-driven techniques to understand chess behavior.

Motivation
I play online chess regularly, but I have never analyzed my own habits systematically. By collecting and analyzing my own game data, I aim to discover strengths, weaknesses, and playing tendencies that can help me improve as a player.

Data Sources
Primary Source: My personal game history from Chess.com (or Lichess.org). Both platforms provide an API that allows users to export all games in PGN or JSON format.
Metadata Fields: Player color, opening name, ECO code, total move count, time control, result, and timestamps of moves.

Data Collection Plan

Use the Chess.com or Lichess API to download my full game history (in JSON or PGN).
Parse move sequences using a Python chess library (e.g. python-chess).
Extract features such as:
 Opening name and ECO code
 The move number when the queen is developed
 Total game length (number of moves)
 Outcome (win, draw, loss)
Store the cleaned data in a structured format (CSV or DataFrame).

Planned Analysis

Descriptive Analysis: Frequency of openings, distribution of game lengths, queen development timing.
Comparative Analysis:
 White vs. Black performance
 Opening type vs. win rate
Visualization:
 Bar plots of opening frequencies
 Histograms of game lengths
 Boxplots for queen development moves
Statistical Insights:
 Correlation between early queen development and win rate 
 Average moves per game outcome

Expected Insights

Identify my most common and most successful openings.
See how my queen development timing affects outcomes.
Understand how my games differ when playing white vs. black.
Observe trends in my playing duration and efficiency.

Tools & Technologies
Python, pandas, NumPy, python-chess, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter Notebook for EDA and visualization
GitHub for version control

Limitations & Future Work
Limited to one playerâ€™s (my) games.
APIs may not include every game if privacy settings restrict access.
Future extensions could include comparison with other players or engine-based accuracy analysis.
